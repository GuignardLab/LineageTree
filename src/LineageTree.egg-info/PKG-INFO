Description: # TGMMlibraries
        
        This libraries allows to read and work with lineage trees produced by TGMM tracking algorithm described in [Fernando et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3036).
        
        ## Description of the repository
          - TGMMlibraries: folder containing the package
          - setup.py: Installation script
          - README.md: This file
          - LICENCE: The licence describing file
        
        ## Basic usage
        Once installed the library can be called the following way (as an example):
        ```python
        from TGMMlibraries import lineageTree
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
        Some dependecies are requiered:
          - general python dependecies:
            - numpy, scipy
            
        ## Quick install
        To quickly install the script so it can be call from the terminal and install too the common dependecies one can run
